# HoloPong

A small Pong game for the Hololens.
This was created during a mini-hackathon of half a day using Unity3D.

It uses the user's gaze to control the paddle and the hand gesture to start a game.
The opposite player is an AI-controlled paddle. It simply follows the ball with a variable precision.
